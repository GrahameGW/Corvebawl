3D Pong. An homage/remake of the classic 90s flash game Curveball (www.curveball-game.com), you play a simple game of pong in 3D space, with the added twist of spin physics making the game far more interesting. 

My first completed solo project. I purposefully focused on a small game that would push my programming ability but I could also finish within a few weeks. v1.0 has endless mode, with three difficulty settings (manipulated by changing the ball speed, AI vision depth, and the curve/magnus force applied). 

Windows executable is available from the repo (download and unzip the archive file); a playable build is available at https://grahamewatt.com/games/corvebawl
